# Billing

Billing is processed annually. We provide a license key that encodes the expiration date, user limit, company name, and pricing plan. This allows the license to be validated locally without sending requests to another server, in line with our Zero Data Exposure policy.

Discounts are available for multi-year commitments and large user counts.
